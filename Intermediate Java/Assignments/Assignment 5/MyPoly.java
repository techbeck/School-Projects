// Outline of the MyPoly class that you must implement for Assignment 5.
// I have provided some data and a couple of methods for you, plus some method headers
// for the methods called from Assig5.java.  You must implement all of those methods but 
// you will likely want to add some other "helper" methods as well, and also some new
// instance variables (esp. for Assig5B.java).

	// additional functionality are incorporated.  Note that the first thing done is
	// a call to super to set up the points in the "regular" Polygon.  Then the color
	// is set and the point circles are created to correspond with each point in the
	// Polygon.
